# MITRO 209 Project Report  

Here, I give an implementation of the 2-approximation algorithm for finding denset subgraph.  

The subject is here: `TextLab.pdf`.  
You can find my report in `latex/report.pdf`.  
You can run the algorithm by compiling `main.cpp`.  
You can add new graphs by adding their paths in `graphs.txt`.  
If necessary, you can process .txt or .csv data with `txt.cpp` or `csv.cpp`.
